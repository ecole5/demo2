# ActiveState Tensorflow Demo

In this tutorial, we will explore using an ActiveState Python runtime to help us explore some data in Jupyter Notebook with Panadas and Matplotlib. We will also learn how to operationalize a TensorFlow model with Flask.

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine and running.
2. Pull the docker image to your machine with ```docker pull ecole5/tensorflow-ml-demo:latest```
2. Make an ActiveState account (www.platform.activestate.com)

# Tutorial 
## 1. Create a new ActiveState project

1. Navigate to www.platform.activestate.com and log in to your account
2. Create a new project with Python 3.10.11 and name it Demo
3. Navigate to the requirements.txt file in this git repository and copy the contents into your clipboard
4. Go back to your project and add the requirements to your new project using the import from file button
5. Go to your project setting, and under the Git Repo field, copy and paste the URL of this repo https://github.com/ActiveState/tensorflow_ml_demo to link your ActiveState runtime

**Talk about build from source right down to system level. 
Talk about ovservability and pdf reports. Talk about depedency hell. **


## 2. Start your container

Using the image you downloaded earlier, spin up a docker container using the following command:

``` docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -p 8000:8000 ecole5/tensorflow-ml-demo:latest```

You will complete the rest of the tutorial in this container.

**Talk about integrating in Devops pipeline **

## 3. Checkout your runtime

In the container, the ActiveState State Tool will already be installed. Checkout the ActiveState runtime you creating using the following command. Replace ORG with the name of your ActiveState organization. 

```state checkout ORG/Demo```

You will notice that the packages you configured on the ActiveState platform will begin to download in addition to the code in this repository.

When you first download a runtime, it will take a while. Updates are fast becasue the files are cached. Escape this process and navigate into 

```cd tensorflow-ml-demo```

Here an ActiveState runtime, and our project files have already been checked out. Notice that the activestate.yaml point to this project https://platform.activestate.com/ActiveStateSE/tensorflow-ml-demo.

**Talk about reproducible runtime envrionemnts and integrating into SDLC **

## 4. Start your virtual enviornment 
1. Inside the tensorflow-ml-demo directory, run the ```state shell``` command.
2. Run ```python``` to start an interactive session with the Python interpreter. 
3. Exit the interactive session and the virtual env (ctrl+c)

## 5. Explore the data using jupyter notebook.
**Talk about making the experiments reproducible by bundling the ide **

1. Go to the data_explore directory ```cd data_explore```
2. Start the jupyter notebook with the ActiveState runtime using ```state exec jupyter -- notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root```
3. Copy the address of the jupyter server and navigate to it in a local browser. For example http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=449902b48ae7b665b9f682d2c4185a9e169f26a4f3c6169d
4. Open the cats_vs_dogs.ipynb Jupyter notebook
5. Run all the cells to generate a report

## 6. Run the tensorflask service
**Talk about compression alogirhtms **
1. Move to the tensorflask directory ```cd ../tensorflask```
2. Start the tensorflask app with ```state exec python3 app.py```
4. On your local machine open a web browser and enter http://localhost:8000/?file=poodle.jpeg and then http://localhost:8000/?file=pug.jpeg to test the model.
